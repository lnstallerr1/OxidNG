**OxidNG Privacy Policy**

This policy is effective from November 17, 2023

oxidvip builds the OxidNG application as an open source application. This service is provided by oxidvip free of charge and is intended to be used as is.

oxidNG respects and protects the personal privacy of all users, so we make this privacy policy public. **Your use of OxidNG means that you have read and agreed to these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, please stop using and uninstall OxidNG immediately. **

**Information Collection**

The OxidNG software itself will not send any information to the developer, but the application market where you download the software (such as Google Play) may collect relevant information about the running status of the application and provide it to the OxidNG developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the application market you use.

The OxidNG software may contain features that need to be unlocked through IAP payment. Your payment information will be processed by the relevant IAP channel, and we have no access to the payment information.

When you report errors in the software to the OxidNG developer, the developer may ask you to provide the software and system logs to help confirm the cause of the problem. Because the logs may include sensitive information, such information can only be sent by you. **We do not make any express or implied guarantees for the security and privacy of any transmission service. Please choose a method that you can accept when transmitting relevant information. **

**Information Sharing**

We will not sell the collected user data to any third party. We may provide information to external developers to assist in the development of software, but we will communicate the relevant confidentiality obligations and ensure that they can comply before providing information.

**Information Retention**

Unless otherwise required by law, we will clear user data that is no longer needed within 30 days, or integrate statistical data into a comprehensive report that cannot identify individual users.

**Information Leakage**

We will use reasonable technology and security means to try our best to protect user data, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data. If we confirm that the data has been leaked, we will notify the user through available channels within 7 days. **You agree not to hold us responsible for any losses caused by force majeure. **

**Children's Privacy**

These Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If I discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary action.

**Terms Modification**

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy, but will ensure that users are notified at least 30 days before the updated terms are updated through our available channels and in-app prompts. **Continued use of the software after the new terms come into effect constitutes your consent to the modified privacy policy. **
